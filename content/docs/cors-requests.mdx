If you try to send requests to the Dojoma API from the browser, your requests will fail with the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code with a message stating "blocked by CORS policy". The Dojoma API does not allow calls directly from browser-based applications.

## Security Considerations

Requests to third-party APIs from front-end applications would expose your credentials on the web, leaving your account vulnerable to fraud and abuse. You should never reveal your API authentication key in publicly accessible code.

### What to Do If Your Key Is Compromised

If you realize your API authentication key has been compromised:

1. Log in to your Dojoma account immediately
2. Go to "Account Details"
3. Find the option to deactivate any of your active API keys
4. Deactivate any compromised key to prevent unauthorized usage
5. Generate new keys from the same page if needed

## Best Practices

To safely use the Dojoma API on your website or application, you can route your requests through your own backend servers. This approach:

- Keeps your credentials hidden
- Allows you to specify CORS policies
- Enables setting rate limits as required by your use case
