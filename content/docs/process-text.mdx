  "thinking": "Hmm... this is a basic arithmetic question. Let me think about it. The question is asking for the sum of 1 and 1. In mathematics, addition is one of the fundamental operations. When you add 1 and 1 together, you are essentially combining two units. This is a foundational concept in early childhood education, often taught using concrete materials like counting blocks or beads in Montessori settings. The answer should be straightforward, but let me double-check to ensure accuracy.",
  "answer": "The sum of 1 and 1 is **2**. \n\n**Explanation:**\n- Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total.\n- When you add 1 and 1, you are essentially counting two individual units.\n- This is a basic mathematical fact that is often introduced to young learners as a starting point for understanding arithmetic.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 100%",

### Node.js Example for `processText` API

To interact with the `http://localhost:3000/v1/processText` API programmatically, you can use Node.js and the `axios` library.

```js title="Node.js"
import axios from "axios";

// Define the API URL and request payload
const apiUrl = "http://localhost:3000/v1/processText";
const apiKey = "your-api-key"; // Replace with your actual API key
const payload = {
  question: "what's 2 + 2=?", // The question you want the API to process
};

// Configure the request headers
const headers = {
  Accept: "*/*", // Accept any response format
  "Content-Type": "application/json", // Indicate the request body is JSON
  "x-api-key": apiKey, // Include the API key for authentication
};

// Send the POST request
axios
  .post(apiUrl, payload, { headers })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Response:", response.data); // Log the API response
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error.message); // Log any error message
    if (error.response) {
      console.error("Response data:", error.response.data); // Log detailed error response
    }
  });
```
